# letsGetPrivate
Website that will guide you through instructions to browse better and safer. **This is a work in progress**.

# why?
I am starting this project to make it easier for people to become/stay private in our online world. Today every corporation knows your every movement on the Internet if you don't protect yourself correctly.

# for who?
For everyone, who wants to browse the better internet. We can end this circus of customers vs companies privacy race. But privacy is a human right, so y'all know who should win that race.
